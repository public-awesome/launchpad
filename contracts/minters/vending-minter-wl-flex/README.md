# Stargaze Vending Minter with Flexible Whitelist Contract

A vending minter designed to have a flexible whitelist. The whitelist is genereated from a snapshot of an existing collection to give a per address limit based on existing NFT ownership.

This removes 3% whitelist limit. It only works with sg-whitelist-flex.
